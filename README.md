# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, i trained unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform customer market segmentation.
Market Segmentation enables sellers to create targeted marketing messages for a specific group of customers which increases the chances of the person buying a product. This helps the companies in establishing better customer relationships and their overall performance as an organization.



**##dataset**
 Credit card data is collected from kaggle dataset.
A customer credit card information dataset can be applied to targeted marketing, customer segmentation, and other similar use cases in the marketing sector.


**##libraries**
Used libraries like Numpy, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib,scikit learn etc



**##Methods**
Found the correlation matrix between different features.
k- means clustering is used for grouping the customers into different clusters.
Principal component analysis(PCA) is used to reduce the number of variables 



**##Findings**
segmented customers into 7 clusters using the elbow mwthod and then applied k-means clustering.
For better visualisation, I applied PCA and reduced to two principal componentsand used seaborn library to visualise the different clusters.
