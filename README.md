# Customer-Segmentation

##Introduction
In this project, i trained unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform customer market segmentation.
Market Segmentation enables sellers to create targeted marketing messages for a specific group of customers which increases the chances of the person buying a product. This helps the companies in establishing better customer relationships and their overall performance as an organization.
##dataset
Credit card data is collected from kaggle dataset.
A customer credit card information dataset can be applied to targeted marketing, customer segmentation, and other similar use cases in the marketing sector.
##Attributes information
BALANCE	, BALANCE_FREQUENCY,	PURCHASES, 	ONEOFF_PURCHASES, 	INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES	, CASH_ADVANCE	, PURCHASES_FREQUENCY,	ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY, 	PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY	, CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY, 	CASH_ADVANCE_TRX	, PURCHASES_TRX	,CREDIT_LIMIT, 	PAYMENTS, 	MINIMUM_PAYMENTS	, PRC_FULL_PAYMENT	, TENURE
##libraries
Used libraries like Numpy, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib,scikit learn etc
##Methods
Found the correlation matrix between different features.
k- means clustering is used for grouping the customers into different clusters.
Principal component analysis(PCA) is used to reduce the number of variables 
##steps
1.importing libraries
2.importing dataset
3.Visualising dataset
4. Finding the missing values and replacing them
5. Checking the duplicate entries
6.Dropping object entries
7.Correlation matrix formation
8.Feature scaling
9. elbow method
10.Applying k-means
11.visualising clusters
12.applying PCA
13. Visualisation
##Findings
segmented customers into 7 clusters using the elbow mwthod and then applied k-means clustering.
For better visualisation, I applied PCA and reduced to two principal componentsand used seaborn library to visualise the different clusters.
